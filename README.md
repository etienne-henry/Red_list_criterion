# Red_list_criterion

Code and metadata associated with the paper "Modelling the probability of meeting IUCN Red List criteria to support reassessments"

Codes 00 and 01 compile all the extinction predictors from the different datasets. 
Although these are not included in the repository, references providing access to all the different raw datasets are available in the corresponding codes and in the paper. 
The dataframe dataset/birds/processed_data/birds_ER_predictors_range_noAUTO.csv combines the predictors of extinction and the Red List category of all the birds used for the analysis. 

Note that some predictors (endemicity, forest dependency & migration status) are not displayed here and are available on request from BirdLife International (science@birdlife.org). 

Code 02_birds_analysis.R calls the script 02_function_analysis.R and executes the analysis to recreate the results.
