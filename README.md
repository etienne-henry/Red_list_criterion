Although these are not included in the repository, references providing access to all the different raw dataset are available in the corresponding codes and in the paper. 
The dataframe data/birds_ER_predictors_range_noAUTO.csv compile all the predictors of extinction and the Red List category of all the birds used for the analysis. 

Code 02_birds_analysis.R call the script 02_function_analysis.R and executes the analysis to recreate the results.
